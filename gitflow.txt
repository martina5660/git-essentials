Essentials:

git --version
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
cat ~/.gitconfig

Create SSH key: ssh-keygen -o
The key is put here: c/User/marti/.ssh/id_rsa
Get SSH key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy/paste this key to GitHub => account => settings => SSH Keys


diff -u file_broken file_fixed => puts on screen
diff -u file_broken file_fixed > file.diff => create a file with differences
cat file.diff
patch file_broken < file.diff => patches a broken file with a diff file

rm filename => remove a file
mkdir => create a dir



Initialize a new repository / add file / commit file / log of changes
git init
git status
git add .
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Message about the commit"

git log --graph
git log --oneline


Clone existing repo from GitHub:
git clone <repo-url>
git log => to see all upates/changes

Push existing repository to remote location
git remote add origin -u <address>
git push -u origin master [git push(command) origin(the name of a remote repo) master(the name of a remote repo's branch)

Info of the remote repository fetch/push
git remote -v



Git flow:
- we have unstaged work (new or updated files)
- we stage our work (adding all changes to be committed)
- we commit our work (adding changes to git repo)
- finally we push our work (git push -u origin master)


Git reset / restore:

git reset HEAD <filename> => unstage an accidentally deleted file
git restore <filename> => restore an accidentally deleted file
git checkout -- <filename> => restores the deleted file as well

Useful Commands:
git reset HEAD [file or folder]
git reset --hard [tag/branch/id] -> forcibly reset all to last commit
git commit -S 	-> commit & signed with GPG (gnupg)
git stash save	-> save all changes in working + index
git stash pop	-> restore changes
git stash list	-> git statuslist all stashes you've saved
